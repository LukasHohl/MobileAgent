The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[201, 30]; text: W\n[97, 30]; text: 6:17 1\n[211, 228]; text: Wed, Feb 5\n[166, 1643]; text: Play Store\n[414, 1643]; text: Gmail\n[662, 1644]; text: Photos\n[910, 1643]; text: YouTube\n[662, 1514]; icon: The icon features a circular design with four overlapping semi-circles in yellow, red, green, and blue, all set against a white background.\n[415, 1514]; icon: The icon features a white circular background with a stylized red, green, and blue \"M\" shape.\n[662, 1969]; icon: The icon is circular, featuring a red, yellow, green, and blue design with a prominent blue circle in the center.\n[168, 1515]; icon: The icon features a triangular play button in green, yellow, red, and blue colors, set against a white circular background.\n[415, 1968]; icon: The icon features a circular white background with a stylized blue speech bubble in the foreground.\n[909, 1968]; icon: The icon features a yellow file shape on a white background, enclosed in a circular golden border.\n[909, 1514]; icon: The icon is a red play button shape centered on a white background, enclosed within a circular border.\n[168, 1969]; icon: The icon features a blue telephone receiver shape on a white circular background.\n[162, 2205]; icon: The icon features a stylized letter \"G\" in bold with blue, red, yellow, and green colors, presented in a circular shape.\n[915, 2206]; icon: The icon features a stylized camera shape with a blue outline, a yellow element on the top, a red section on the left, and green and blue circles.\n[789, 2207]; icon: The icon features a blue microphone shape with a colorful semicircular base in red, yellow, and green.\n[165, 1968]; icon: The icon is shaped like a telephone receiver and is primarily blue in color.\n[172, 1514]; icon: The icon features a triangular play button composed of blue, green, yellow, and red segments.\n[416, 1509]; icon: The icon features a stylized envelope shape in red, with a blue and green outline, and a yellow accent on the top.\n[259, 31]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rectangular document with a slightly curved top and is predominantly white in color.\n[907, 1968]; icon: The icon is predominantly yellow with a rounded shape that features a circular silhouette and a small rectangular base at the bottom.\n[416, 1975]; icon: The icon features a stylized speech bubble shape, predominantly in a medium blue color with a lighter blue background.\n[662, 1969]; icon: The icon features a circular blue shape surrounded by a thick white outline, set against a colorful background with red, yellow, and green segments.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1514}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Instead of opening Google Chrome, the action opened Google Photos. This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the wrong icon was selected.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[80, 30]; text: 6:18\n[211, 228]; text: Wed, Feb 5\n[166, 1643]; text: Play Store\n[414, 1643]; text: Gmail\n[662, 1644]; text: Photos\n[910, 1643]; text: YouTube\n[662, 1514]; icon: The icon features a circular design with four segments in red, yellow, green, and blue, arranged in a pinwheel pattern.\n[909, 1968]; icon: The icon features a circular design with a white center and a yellow outer ring, showcasing a symmetrical arrangement of four colored sections: red, green, blue, and yellow.\n[662, 1969]; icon: The icon is in the shape of a circular logo with red, green, yellow, and blue segments surrounding a central blue circle.\n[415, 1514]; icon: The icon is a stylized letter \"M\" comprised of red, blue, yellow, and green colors, set within a circular white background.\n[168, 1514]; icon: The icon features a triangular shape with blue, green, yellow, and red colors, set against a white circular background.\n[415, 1968]; icon: The icon features a speech bubble shape in various shades of blue, set against a circular white background.\n[909, 1514]; icon: The icon features a red play button symbol centered on a white background, all contained within a circular shape.\n[168, 1969]; icon: The icon features a blue telephone handset shape on a white circular background.\n[162, 2205]; icon: The icon is shaped like a stylized letter \"G\" and features a combination of red, yellow, green, and blue colors.\n[915, 2206]; icon: The icon features a camera outline composed of blue, yellow, red, and green colors, with a circular blue shape in the center and smaller green and red circles.\n[789, 2207]; icon: The icon features a blue microphone shape on top, with a multi-colored semicircular base in red, yellow, and green, and a green vertical line at the bottom.\n[165, 1968]; icon: The icon is shaped like a telephone receiver and is colored in a solid blue hue.\n[172, 1514]; icon: The icon features a triangular shape composed of four sections in blue, green, yellow, and red colors.\n[259, 31]; icon: The icon is shaped like a memory card and is predominantly white with a subtle gray background.\n[416, 1509]; icon: The icon features a stylized red envelope shape with a white interior and colored elements including blue, yellow, and green accents on the sides.\n[143, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a keyhole and is white in color.\n[201, 30]; icon: The icon features a shield shape in a light color with a stylized letter \"S\" formed inside it.\n[949, 30]; icon: The icon features three white shapes: a semicircle, a triangle, and a battery silhouette, all set against a gray background.\n[910, 28]; icon: The icon is shaped like an upward-pointing triangle and is colored white.\n[907, 1969]; icon: The icon is circular with four colored sections: yellow, red, green, and blue.\n[416, 1975]; icon: The icon features a speech bubble shape in a vibrant blue color with a lighter blue background.\n[662, 1969]; icon: The icon is circular with a blue center and a surrounding white outline, accented by sections of red, green, and yellow at the edges.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1514}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Instead of opening Google Chrome, the action opened Google Photos. This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the wrong icon was selected.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and correctly tap on the Google Chrome icon to proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1514}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Instead of opening Google Chrome, the action opened Google Photos. This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the wrong icon was selected.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and correctly tap on the Google Chrome icon to proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1969}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Survey Papers Identified**:  - **[2402.06196] Large Language Models: A Survey** by S Minaee, 2024, cited 522 times.  - **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models** by WX Zhao, 2023, cited 3511 times. 2. **Most Cited Paper**:  - Title: **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models**  - Abstract: \"In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1514}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Instead of opening Google Chrome, the action opened Google Photos. This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the wrong icon was selected.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and correctly tap on the Google Chrome icon to proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1969}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'survey papers on Large Language Models'}} | Description: Tapping on the search bar, typing \"survey papers on Large Language Models,\" and pressing Enter to initiate the search. This will display relevant results for the query. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Survey Papers Identified**:   - **[2402.06196] Large Language Models: A Survey** by S Minaee, 2024, cited 522 times.   - **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models** by WX Zhao, 2023, cited 3511 times.  2. **Most Cited Paper**:   - Title: **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models**   - Abstract: \"In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1514}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Instead of opening Google Chrome, the action opened Google Photos. This indicates that the tap was either misaligned or the wrong icon was selected.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and correctly tap on the Google Chrome icon to proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1969}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'survey papers on Large Language Models'}} | Description: Tapping on the search bar, typing \"survey papers on Large Language Models,\" and pressing Enter to initiate the search. This will display relevant results for the query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and open the Google Keep Notes app for creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2400 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[80, 29]; text: 6:22\n[201, 30]; text: O\n[841, 146]; text: \u5415\n[350, 145]; text: Search your notes\n[540, 1354]; text: Notes you add appear here\n[963, 2222]; text: \u5341\n[538, 1127]; icon: The icon is shaped like a light bulb with a rounded top and a narrower base, and it is colored in a bright yellow.\n[963, 2220]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners, colored deep blue, featuring a white plus sign in the center.\n[967, 145]; icon: The icon is a circular shape with a brown background featuring a white letter \"L\" in the center.\n[839, 145]; icon: The icon features two horizontal rectangles stacked on top of each other, both filled with a dark gray color.\n[259, 30]; icon: The icon is a gray, rectangular shape with a rounded corner, resembling a memory card, featuring three small rectangles on the top side.\n[78, 31]; icon: The icon displays a simple numeric representation of the time \"6:22\" in a gray color.\n[143, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a traditional keyhole, predominantly in a gray color.\n[115, 145]; icon: The icon consists of three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, rendered in a dark gray color against a light background.\n[963, 2221]; icon: The icon features a white plus sign on a solid blue background.\n[910, 29]; icon: The icon is shaped like a gray semicircle.\n[948, 30]; icon: The icon features three shapes: a dark gray semicircle, a dark gray right triangle, and a dark gray battery outline.\n[201, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a shield and is primarily in a gray color with a stylized \"S\" in the center.\n[158, 30]; icon: The icons are in various shades of gray, featuring a keyhole shape, a shield shape, and a rectangular shape with a cut-out resembling a SIM card.\n[950, 31]; icon: The icon is shaped like a right triangle and is a dark gray color.\n[994, 31]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners and features a dark gray color.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Survey Papers Identified**:   - **[2402.06196] Large Language Models: A Survey** by S Minaee, 2024, cited 522 times.   - **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models** by WX Zhao, 2023, cited 3511 times.  2. **Most Cited Paper**:   - Title: **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models**   - Abstract: \"In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and correctly tap on the Google Chrome icon to proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1969}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'survey papers on Large Language Models'}} | Description: Tapping on the search bar, typing \"survey papers on Large Language Models,\" and pressing Enter to initiate the search. This will display relevant results for the query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and open the Google Keep Notes app for creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 909, 'y': 1968}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Keep Notes icon to open the app and proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

The next step is to select the \"Text\" option to create a new note and add the titles of the papers and the abstract of the most cited paper.\n\n### Important Notes ###\n1. **Survey Papers Identified**:   - **[2402.06196] Large Language Models: A Survey** by S Minaee, 2024, cited 522 times.   - **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models** by WX Zhao, 2023, cited 3511 times.  2. **Most Cited Paper**:   - Title: **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models**   - Abstract: \"In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques.\"\n\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here.

Its width and height are 1080 and 2400 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[201, 30]; text: S\n[81, 30]; text: 6:25\n[837, 145]; text: \u5415\n[350, 146]; text: Search your notes\n[540, 1353]; text: Notes you add appear here\n[849, 1580]; text: Image\n[832, 1737]; text: Drawing\n[877, 1893]; text: List\n[964, 2052]; text: Tr\n[870, 2051]; text: Text\n[964, 2220]; text: \u00d7\n[539, 1127]; icon: The icon features a bulb shape at the top, connected to a narrower rectangular base, all rendered in a dark yellowish-brown color.\n[963, 2220]; icon: The icon is a rounded square with a blue background and a white \"X\" symbol in the center.\n[893, 1578]; icon: The icon is a rounded rectangular shape with a light blue background and dark blue text that says \"Image,\" accompanied by a small graphic of mountains.\n[963, 1577]; icon: The icon features a square shape with a dark blue background and stylized mountains depicted in a lighter shade of blue.\n[872, 1736]; icon: The icon is oval-shaped with a light blue background and features dark blue text that says \"Drawing,\" accompanied by a small paintbrush graphic.\n[967, 145]; icon: The icon is circular in shape with a dark background and features a light gray letter \"L\" in the center.\n[911, 2051]; icon: The icon has an oval shape and a light blue background with dark blue text that reads \"Text\" alongside the letters \"Tt.\"\n[916, 1894]; icon: The icon is oval-shaped with a light blue background and features dark blue text reading \"List\" alongside a dark blue checkmark in a square.\n[964, 1893]; icon: The icon is square with rounded corners, featuring a white check mark on a dark blue background.\n[840, 145]; icon: The icon features two horizontal rectangular shapes stacked on top of each other, presented in a dark color against a contrasting background.\n[259, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a small, rectangular memory card and is primarily black with three white vertical lines at the top.\n[78, 31]; icon: The icon displays the time \"6:25\" in a simple, rectangular shape with a dark background and light-colored text.\n[964, 1736]; icon: The icon features a dark blue paintbrush shape, leaning to one side with a rounded tip at the end.\n[949, 29]; icon: The icon features three shapes: a curved segment, a right triangle, and a battery outline, all in a dark gray color against a light gray background.\n[116, 145]; icon: The icon consists of three horizontal black bars stacked evenly, resembling a menu or navigation symbol.\n[143, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a keyhole with a circular top and a narrow bottom, and it is black in color.\n[910, 29]; icon: The icon is shaped like an inverted triangle and is colored black.\n[963, 2219]; icon: The icon is a white, stylized \"X\" shape on a dark blue background.\n[201, 30]; icon: The icon features a shield shape outlined in black with a stylized \"S\" in the center, set against a dark background.\n[158, 30]; icon: The icons are predominantly dark gray, featuring distinct shapes such as a keyhole, a shield, and a SIM card tray, all with a minimalist design.\n[994, 30]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners and is a solid black color.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Survey Papers Identified**:   - **[2402.06196] Large Language Models: A Survey** by S Minaee, 2024, cited 522 times.   - **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models** by WX Zhao, 2023, cited 3511 times.  2. **Most Cited Paper**:   - Title: **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models**   - Abstract: \"In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 662, 'y': 1969}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Chrome icon to open the browser and proceed with the search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'survey papers on Large Language Models'}} | Description: Tapping on the search bar, typing \"survey papers on Large Language Models,\" and pressing Enter to initiate the search. This will display relevant results for the query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and open the Google Keep Notes app for creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 909, 'y': 1968}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Keep Notes icon to open the app and proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 963, 'y': 2220}} | Description: Tapping on the blue \"+\" icon to create a new note in Google Keep Notes. This will allow me to add the titles of the papers and the abstract of the most cited paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2400 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[78, 29]; text: 6:26\n[201, 30]; text: O\n[761, 144]; text: 4\n[73, 146]; text: <\n[111, 324]; text: Title\n[97, 422]; text: Note\n[63, 2158]; text: +\n[539, 2159]; text: Edited just now\n[536, 2250]; text: ADB Keyboard {ON}\n[188, 2159]; icon: The icon is shaped like a painter's palette with a rounded base and has a gray color.\n[62, 2159]; icon: The icon is a square with rounded corners in a dark gray color featuring a white plus sign in the center.\n[1016, 144]; icon: The icon is square-shaped and predominantly gray, featuring a downward-pointing arrow inside a box.\n[889, 143]; icon: The icon features a bell shape with a plus sign inside, rendered in a gray color.\n[762, 143]; icon: The icon is shaped like a bell with a rounded top and a narrow base, and it is displayed in a dark gray color.\n[315, 2159]; icon: The icon features a bold, capital letter \"A\" in a dark gray color, set above a horizontal line, all against a light gray background.\n[259, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a memory card with a rounded edge and features a gray color.\n[73, 145]; icon: The icon is a black left-pointing arrow, typically situated within a square or rectangular shape.\n[1016, 2159]; icon: The icon consists of three vertically stacked circles, all in a dark gray color.\n[143, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a keyhole, with a rounded top and a wider base, and it is colored in a solid gray.\n[78, 30]; icon: The icon displays the time \"6:26\" in a simple, gray font on a light background.\n[909, 29]; icon: The icon is a dark gray, semi-circular shape.\n[948, 30]; icon: The icon features three shapes: a gray semicircle, a gray triangle, and a gray battery symbol, all in a uniform dark gray color.\n[96, 423]; icon: The icon features a simple rectangular shape with a light grey background and the word \"Note\" in a darker grey font.\n[966, 2335]; icon: The icon features a rectangular shape with a series of small, evenly spaced squares arranged in two rows above a wider rectangular bar, all in white against a black background.\n[111, 323]; icon: The icon features a rectangular shape with a light gray background and the word \"Title\" displayed in a darker gray font.\n[201, 30]; icon: The icon is a simple, stylized shield shape in a muted gray color, featuring a curved line that resembles an \"S\" within it.\n[111, 2335]; icon: The icon is shaped like a downward-pointing triangle and is colored white against a black background.\n[950, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a triangle, featuring a gradient from dark gray to light gray.\n[157, 30]; icon: The icon is shield-shaped and is colored in a dark gray.\n[993, 30]; icon: The icon is a rectangular shape with rounded corners, colored in a shade of gray.\n[891, 143]; icon: The icon features a simple, minimalist design in gray, consisting of a bell shape with a cross inside it.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Survey Papers Identified**:   - **[2402.06196] Large Language Models: A Survey** by S Minaee, 2024, cited 522 times.   - **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models** by WX Zhao, 2023, cited 3511 times.  2. **Most Cited Paper**:   - Title: **[2303.18223] A Survey of Large Language Models**   - Abstract: \"In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques.\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Type(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'survey papers on Large Language Models'}} | Description: Tapping on the search bar, typing \"survey papers on Large Language Models,\" and pressing Enter to initiate the search. This will display relevant results for the query. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: Returning to the home screen to locate and open the Google Keep Notes app for creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 909, 'y': 1968}} | Description: Tapping on the Google Keep Notes icon to open the app and proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 963, 'y': 2220}} | Description: Tapping on the blue \"+\" icon to create a new note in Google Keep Notes. This will allow me to add the titles of the papers and the abstract of the most cited paper. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 870, 'y': 2051}} | Description: Tapping on the \"Text\" option to create a new text note in Google Keep Notes, enabling me to input the titles of the papers and the abstract of the most cited paper. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
