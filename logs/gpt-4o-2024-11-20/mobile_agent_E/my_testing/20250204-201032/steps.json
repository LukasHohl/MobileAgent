The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[99, 32]; text: 7:10 1\n[201, 30]; text: W\n[201, 228]; text: Tue, Feb 4\n[166, 1643]; text: Play Store\n[414, 1643]; text: Gmail\n[662, 1644]; text: Photos\n[910, 1643]; text: YouTube\n[662, 1514]; icon: The icon features a circular design divided into four segments, colored yellow, red, green, and blue.\n[415, 1514]; icon: The icon features a stylized \"M\" in red, blue, and green colors, enclosed within a circular white background.\n[662, 1969]; icon: The icon is circular, featuring a blue center surrounded by red, yellow, and green segments.\n[168, 1515]; icon: The icon features a play button shape with a green triangle on top, a yellow triangle to the right, a blue triangle on the left, and a red triangle at the bottom, all surrounded by a white circular background.\n[415, 1968]; icon: The icon features a speech bubble shape in varying shades of blue, set against a white circular background.\n[909, 1968]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rounded rectangle and is primarily yellow with a white circular detail inside.\n[909, 1514]; icon: The icon features a red play button within a white oval shape, all surrounded by a circular black background.\n[168, 1969]; icon: The icon features a blue telephone handset shape set against a white circular background.\n[162, 2205]; icon: The icon features a stylized letter \"G\" in blue, with red, yellow, and green sections surrounding it, all set against a white background.\n[915, 2206]; icon: The icon features a camera outline in blue, with a red and green circular element and a yellow arc, all set against a white background.\n[789, 2207]; icon: The icon features a stylized microphone shape with a blue upper part, a red and yellow semicircular element at the bottom, and a green base.\n[165, 1968]; icon: The icon is shaped like a telephone receiver and is predominantly blue in color.\n[172, 1514]; icon: The icon features a triangular shape divided into four sections, colored blue, green, red, and yellow.\n[416, 1509]; icon: The icon features a stylized envelope shape with a red 'M' in the center, complemented by blue, yellow, and green accents.\n[259, 31]; icon: The icon is a white square with rounded corners, featuring three horizontal lines near the top.\n[907, 1968]; icon: The icon is predominantly yellow and features a rounded shape at the top with a small horizontal line at the bottom.\n[416, 1975]; icon: The icon is a speech bubble shape, primarily colored in a vibrant blue with a lighter blue shadow effect.\n[662, 1968]; icon: The icon features a blue circular shape outlined in white, surrounded by red, green, and yellow segments.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Its width and height are 1080 and 2400 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[82, 31]; text: 7:12\n[201, 30]; text: W\n[201, 228]; text: Tue, Feb 4\n[166, 1643]; text: Play Store\n[414, 1643]; text: Gmail\n[662, 1644]; text: Photos\n[910, 1643]; text: YouTube\n[662, 1514]; icon: The icon features a circular design with four colored segments: red, blue, green, and yellow, arranged in a pinwheel shape.\n[415, 1514]; icon: The icon features a stylized red letter \"M\" with green and blue accents, set against a circular white background.\n[662, 1969]; icon: The icon is a circular shape divided into four segments colored red, green, yellow, and blue, with a blue circle in the center.\n[168, 1514]; icon: The icon features a triangular play button in blue, green, yellow, and red, set against a white circular background.\n[415, 1968]; icon: The icon features a speech bubble shape in various shades of blue, set against a white circular background.\n[909, 1968]; icon: The icon features a yellow rectangular shape with a white circular element at the bottom, all set against a circular light yellow background.\n[909, 1514]; icon: The icon features a red play button in the shape of a triangle, set against a white circular background.\n[168, 1969]; icon: The icon is circular with a white background and features a blue telephone handset shape.\n[162, 2205]; icon: The icon features a bold letter \"G\" in a stylized font, primarily colored in blue with accents of red, yellow, and green.\n[915, 2206]; icon: The icon features a camera shape outlined in red, blue, and yellow, with a large blue circle in the center and a smaller green circle in the bottom right.\n[789, 2207]; icon: The icon features a blue microphone shape with a curved red, yellow, and green line underneath it.\n[165, 1968]; icon: The icon is shaped like a classic telephone receiver and is colored in a solid blue.\n[172, 1514]; icon: The icon features a triangular play button shape, comprised of blue, red, yellow, and green colors.\n[416, 1509]; icon: The icon is shaped like an envelope with a prominent red \"M\" in the center, complemented by blue, yellow, and green elements around the edges.\n[259, 31]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rectangular document or note, predominantly white with three horizontal lines at the top.\n[907, 1968]; icon: The icon features a rounded shape with a light yellow background and a white circular element in the center, topped with a triangular corner.\n[416, 1975]; icon: The icon features a stylized speech bubble shape in a deep blue color, with a lighter blue outline and a pointed tail.\n[662, 1968]; icon: The icon features a blue circle surrounded by a white ring, with a colorful border of red, green, and yellow.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to search for survey papers on Large Language Models. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The Chrome browser was not successfully opened. The screen remains on the home screen, and there is no indication that the Chrome app was launched.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
