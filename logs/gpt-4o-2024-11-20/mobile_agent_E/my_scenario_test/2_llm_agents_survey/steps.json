Its width and height are 1080 and 2400 pixels, respectively.\nTo help you better understand the content in this screenshot, we have extracted positional information for the text elements and icons, including interactive elements such as search bars. The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[102, 30]; text: 2:01\n[202, 31]; text: C\n[217, 227]; text: Sun, Feb 16\n[661, 1316]; text: Maps\n[415, 1315]; text: Chrome\n[169, 1317]; text: Keep Notes\n[166, 1643]; text: Play Store\n[415, 1643]; text: Gmail\n[662, 1644]; text: Photos\n[910, 1643]; text: YouTube\n[662, 1186]; icon: The icon is shaped like a location marker and features a combination of red, blue, yellow, and green colors arranged in a geometric pattern on a white circular background.\n[415, 1186]; icon: The icon is circular, featuring a blue center surrounded by red, yellow, and green segments.\n[662, 1968]; icon: The icon is a circular design featuring segments in red, green, yellow, and a blue circle in the center, all set against a yellow background.\n[662, 1514]; icon: The icon features a circular design with four overlapping shapes in red, yellow, green, and blue, arranged in a way that resembles a pinwheel against a white background.\n[168, 1186]; icon: The icon features a yellow paper-like shape with a rounded bottom and a circular symbol in the center, all enclosed within a white circle.\n[415, 1514]; icon: The icon features a stylized red and blue \"M\" on a white circular background, with a green triangle on the right side.\n[909, 1968]; icon: The icon features a yellow rectangle with a rounded corner, displaying a white circular symbol within it, all set against a yellow circular background.\n[415, 1968]; icon: The icon features a speech bubble shape in various shades of blue, set against a white circular background.\n[168, 1515]; icon: The icon is a circular shape with a prominent play button in the center, using colors like blue, green, yellow, and red.\n[909, 1514]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded edges, featuring a red background and a white play button in the center, all enclosed within a white circular border.\n[168, 1969]; icon: The icon is circular with a white background featuring a blue telephone handset silhouette.\n[162, 2205]; icon: The icon features a stylized letter \"G\" composed of blue, red, yellow, and green colors, with a rounded shape.\n[915, 2206]; icon: The icon features a camera outline with a combination of blue, red, yellow, and green colors, along with circular shapes inside.\n[789, 2207]; icon: The icon features a blue microphone shape on top of a colorful half-circle comprised of red, yellow, and green elements, with a green line at the bottom.\n[165, 1968]; icon: The icon is shaped like a stylized phone receiver and is predominantly blue.\n[172, 1514]; icon: The icon is shaped like a right-facing triangle composed of four colorful sections: blue, green, yellow, and red.\n[416, 1509]; icon: The icon features a stylized envelope shape primarily in red, with blue, yellow, and green accents.\n[168, 1184]; icon: The icon is predominantly yellow, featuring a rounded shape at the top with a smaller circular shape and a horizontal bar at the bottom.\n[662, 1185]; icon: The icon features a pin shape colored with blue at the top, yellow and red on the sides, and a green bottom, with a white circular center.\n[907, 1968]; icon: The icon features a rounded shape with a light yellow background and a darker yellow outline, along with a white symbol resembling a light bulb or idea.\n[416, 1975]; icon: The icon features a speech bubble shape, primarily colored in blue with a lighter blue background.\n[663, 1969]; icon: The icon is circular with a blue center, surrounded by a white ring and set against a background featuring red, green, and yellow segments.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to proceed to the next step of navigating to Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to proceed to the next step of navigating to Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'Google Scholar'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Google Scholar,\" and press Enter to navigate to the Google Scholar website. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to proceed to the next step of navigating to Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'Google Scholar'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Google Scholar,\" and press Enter to navigate to the Google Scholar website. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 323, 'y': 732}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Google Scholar\" link to navigate to the Google Scholar website, where I can proceed with searching for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Large language model based multi-agents: A survey of progress and challenges**   Authors: T Guo, X Chen, Y Wang, R Chang, S Pei   Source: arXiv preprint, 2024  2. **A Survey of LLM-based Agents: Theories, Technologies, Applications and Suggestions**   Authors: X Dong, X Zhang, W Bu, D Zhang   Source: 2024 3rd International Conference, IEEE Xplore  3. **Generation of Scientific Literature Surveys Based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**   Authors: R Qi, W Li, H Lyu   Source: CCF International Conference on Natural Language Processing, Springer, 2024\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to proceed to the next step of navigating to Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'Google Scholar'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Google Scholar,\" and press Enter to navigate to the Google Scholar website. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 323, 'y': 732}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Google Scholar\" link to navigate to the Google Scholar website, where I can proceed with searching for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 661, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and press Enter to initiate the search on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Large language model based multi-agents: A survey of progress and challenges**   Authors: T Guo, X Chen, Y Wang, R Chang, S Pei   Source: arXiv preprint, 2024  2. **A Survey of LLM-based Agents: Theories, Technologies, Applications and Suggestions**   Authors: X Dong, X Zhang, W Bu, D Zhang   Source: 2024 3rd International Conference, IEEE Xplore  3. **Generation of Scientific Literature Surveys Based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**   Authors: R Qi, W Li, H Lyu   Source: CCF International Conference on Natural Language Processing, Springer, 2024\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: This action will open the Chrome browser, allowing me to proceed to the next step of navigating to Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'Google Scholar'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Google Scholar,\" and press Enter to navigate to the Google Scholar website. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 323, 'y': 732}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Google Scholar\" link to navigate to the Google Scholar website, where I can proceed with searching for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 661, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and press Enter to initiate the search on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Keep Notes app to proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[103, 30]; text: 2:06\n[201, 30]; text: G\n[840, 146]; text: \u5415\n[350, 145]; text: Search your notes\n[967, 148]; text: H\n[540, 1354]; text: Notes you add appear here\n[963, 2222]; text: \u5341\n[538, 1127]; icon: The icon is shaped like a light bulb with a rounded top and a wider base, and it is colored bright yellow.\n[963, 2220]; icon: The icon is a rounded square with a blue background and a white plus sign in the center.\n[967, 145]; icon: The icon is circular and features a bright pink background with a white letter \"H\" in the center.\n[840, 145]; icon: The icon features two horizontal rectangular shapes stacked vertically, outlined in a dark gray color.\n[259, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a rectangular memory card with a notched edge, and it is displayed in a grey color.\n[910, 29]; icon: The icon is a semicircular shape in a dark gray color.\n[963, 2221]; icon: The icon features a white plus sign against a solid blue background.\n[115, 146]; icon: The icon features a series of three horizontal lines in a dark gray color on a lighter gray background.\n[950, 32]; icon: The icon has a triangular shape and is colored in a dark gray tone.\n[201, 31]; icon: The icon is circular in shape with a gray \"G\" inside it.\n[994, 30]; icon: The icon is a rectangular shape with rounded corners, primarily colored in dark gray.\n[949, 30]; icon: The icon consists of a dark gray semicircle, a dark gray right triangle, and a dark gray battery shape, all displayed in a minimalist design.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Large language model based multi-agents: A survey of progress and challenges**   Authors: T Guo, X Chen, Y Wang, R Chang, S Pei   Source: arXiv preprint, 2024  2. **A Survey of LLM-based Agents: Theories, Technologies, Applications and Suggestions**   Authors: X Dong, X Zhang, W Bu, D Zhang   Source: 2024 3rd International Conference, IEEE Xplore  3. **Generation of Scientific Literature Surveys Based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**   Authors: R Qi, W Li, H Lyu   Source: CCF International Conference on Natural Language Processing, Springer, 2024\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 301, 'y': 516, 'text': 'Google Scholar'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"Google Scholar,\" and press Enter to navigate to the Google Scholar website. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 323, 'y': 732}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Google Scholar\" link to navigate to the Google Scholar website, where I can proceed with searching for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 661, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and press Enter to initiate the search on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Keep Notes app to proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Keep Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Keep Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Large language model based multi-agents: A survey of progress and challenges**   Authors: T Guo, X Chen, Y Wang, R Chang, S Pei   Source: arXiv preprint, 2024  2. **A Survey of LLM-based Agents: Theories, Technologies, Applications and Suggestions**   Authors: X Dong, X Zhang, W Bu, D Zhang   Source: 2024 3rd International Conference, IEEE Xplore  3. **Generation of Scientific Literature Surveys Based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**   Authors: R Qi, W Li, H Lyu   Source: CCF International Conference on Natural Language Processing, Springer, 2024\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 323, 'y': 732}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Google Scholar\" link to navigate to the Google Scholar website, where I can proceed with searching for survey papers on LLM agents. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 661, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and press Enter to initiate the search on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Keep Notes app to proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Keep Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Keep Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 963, 'y': 2220}} | Description: This action will tap the blue \"+\" icon to create a new note in Keep Notes, allowing me to add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Large language model based multi-agents: A survey of progress and challenges**   Authors: T Guo, X Chen, Y Wang, R Chang, S Pei   Source: arXiv preprint, 2024  2. **A Survey of LLM-based Agents: Theories, Technologies, Applications and Suggestions**   Authors: X Dong, X Zhang, W Bu, D Zhang   Source: 2024 3rd International Conference, IEEE Xplore  3. **Generation of Scientific Literature Surveys Based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**   Authors: R Qi, W Li, H Lyu   Source: CCF International Conference on Natural Language Processing, Springer, 2024\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Type(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 661, 'text': 'survey papers on LLM agents'}} | Description: This action will tap on the search bar, type \"survey papers on LLM agents,\" and press Enter to initiate the search on Google Scholar. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Keep Notes app to proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Keep Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Keep Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 963, 'y': 2220}} | Description: This action will tap the blue \"+\" icon to create a new note in Keep Notes, allowing me to add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 870, 'y': 2051}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Text\" option to create a new text note in Keep Notes, allowing me to add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has been activated and you can type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n1. **Large language model based multi-agents: A survey of progress and challenges**   Authors: T Guo, X Chen, Y Wang, R Chang, S Pei   Source: arXiv preprint, 2024  2. **A Survey of LLM-based Agents: Theories, Technologies, Applications and Suggestions**   Authors: X Dong, X Zhang, W Bu, D Zhang   Source: 2024 3rd International Conference, IEEE Xplore  3. **Generation of Scientific Literature Surveys Based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**   Authors: R Qi, W Li, H Lyu   Source: CCF International Conference on Natural Language Processing, Springer, 2024\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Type(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: This action will return to the home screen, allowing me to locate and open the Keep Notes app to proceed with creating a new note. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Keep Notes'}} | Description: This action will open the Keep Notes app, allowing me to create a new note and add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 963, 'y': 2220}} | Description: This action will tap the blue \"+\" icon to create a new note in Keep Notes, allowing me to add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 870, 'y': 2051}} | Description: This action will tap on the \"Text\" option to create a new text note in Keep Notes, allowing me to add the titles of the three identified survey papers. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Type', 'arguments': {'text': '1. Large language model based multi-agents: A survey of progress and challenges\\n2. A Survey of LLM-based Agents: Theories, Technologies, Applications and Suggestions\\n3.

After this, I will save the note. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Stop at the screen displaying the video.\n\n---\nCarefully reflect on the interaction history of the current task. Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
