If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 909, 'y': 1514}} | Description: I will tap on the YouTube app icon to open the application and proceed to search for the recipe tutorial. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[102, 30]; text: 2:13 \n[201, 30]; text: G\n[262, 21]; text: m\n[375, 125]; text: Chinese-style beef o..\n[652, 126]; text: X\n[212, 277]; text: About these results\n[323, 584]; text: Pi\n[1006, 585]; text: cc\n[555, 915]; text: 2.VORHALTER\n[470, 1264]; text: keiner mag unfallut Nummer\n[943, 1263]; text: Z achte\n[581, 1339]; text: darauf wie viele vorhalte der warn hat\n[424, 1525]; text: Wo jeder Moment zahIt. |TikTok\n[352, 1582]; text: Trete der Gemeinschaft bei\n[287, 1635]; text: Sponsored\u00b74.4\u2605\n[279, 1737]; text: Watch\n[796, 1736]; text: Install\n[971, 2279]; text: H\nyou\n[538, 2276]; text: \u5341\n[105, 2307]; text: Home\n[323, 2305]; text: Shorts\n[754, 2306]; text: Subscriptions\n[78, 1545]; icon: The icon features a stylized musical note shape with a black background, and the note is colored in shades of teal and pink.\n[539, 2273]; icon: The icon features a simple black plus sign enclosed within a thin circular outline, on a white background.\n[910, 124]; icon: The icon features a black rectangular shape with a rounded rectangle in the center and three curved lines emanating from the lower left, also in black.\n[971, 2255]; icon: The icon is circular and has a bright pink background with a white letter \"H\" in the center.\n[324, 2254]; icon: The icon features a stylized letter \"B\" with a play button integrated into its design, depicted in black.\n[325, 586]; icon: The icon features a rectangular shape with a gradient of blue colors, displaying the letters \"P\" and \"I\" in a lighter shade.\n[800, 1735]; icon: The icon is an elongated oval shape in a bright blue color with the word \"Install\" displayed in bold white text.\n[755, 2258]; icon: The icon features a rectangular shape with a black outline, a horizontal line at the top, and a solid black triangle play button situated in the center.\n[1006, 585]; icon: The icon is rectangular with rounded corners and features a white background with bold black letters \"CC\" in the center.\n[108, 2256]; icon: The icon is shaped like a house, featuring a triangular roof and a rectangular door, and it is entirely black.\n[785, 124]; icon: The icon features a black microphone symbol set against a white circular background.\n[785, 125]; icon: The icon is a black microphone shape with a rounded top and a curved line beneath it, set against a light background.\n[393, 275]; icon: The icon is circular with a black outline, featuring a lowercase \"i\" in the center, which is also black.\n[1002, 460]; icon: The icon features a combination of a stylized phone handset and a muted sound wave symbol, rendered in a simple white silhouette against a darker background.\n[299, 911]; icon: The icon features a large white number \"2\" on a dark background, enclosed within a square shape.\n[279, 1735]; icon: The icon features the word \"Watch\" in blue text on a white background.\n[74, 124]; icon: The icon is a black, left-pointing arrow shape on a white background.\n[798, 1735]; icon: The icon features a rectangular shape with a blue background and white text that reads \"Install.\"\n[653, 125]; icon: The icon is a black \"X\" shape on a light background.\n[259, 30]; icon: The icon is shaped like a small, rectangular memory card with a cut corner, and it is gray in color.\n[948, 30]; icon: The icon consists of three shapes: a gray semicircle, a gray triangle, and a gray battery-like rectangle.\n[423, 126]; icon: The icon has a rounded rectangular shape with a light background and black text displaying the phrase \"Chinese-style beef o...\".\n[107, 2276]; icon: The icon is shaped like a house and is colored in solid black.\n[910, 29]; icon: The icon is shaped like a semicircle and is colored dark gray.\n[201, 31]; icon: The icon is shaped like the letter \"G\" and is rendered in a gray color.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo relevant video tutorial for \"Chinese-style beef onion potato recipe under 1 hour\" is visible in the current screenshot. Continue browsing the search results to locate a suitable video.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 909, 'y': 1514}} | Description: I will tap on the YouTube app icon to open the application and proceed to search for the recipe tutorial. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 540, 'y': 553, 'text': 'Chinese-style beef onion potato recipe under 1 hour'}} | Description: I will tap the search bar, type the query \"Chinese-style beef onion potato recipe under 1 hour,\" and press Enter to search for relevant video tutorials. This will display the search results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation.

To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\nType(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\nEnter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\nSwitch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\nBack(): Return to the previous state.\nHome(): Return to home page.\nWait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n### Existing Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nHere are some existing shortcuts you have created:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Full Action History ###\n- Action: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 909, 'y': 1514}} | Description: I will tap on the YouTube app icon to open the application and proceed to search for the recipe tutorial. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The YouTube app has been successfully opened.

This will display the search results. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The search query \"Chinese-style beef onion potato recipe under 1 hour\" has been successfully entered, and the search results are displayed. The next step is to locate a relevant video tutorial from the search results.\n- Action: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll down the page and reveal more search results, aiming to find a relevant video tutorial for the requested recipe. | Outcome: Successful | Progress: The search results now display a relevant video tutorial titled \"Chinese Braised Beef & Potato Stew (Chinese Style Cooking Recipe)\" by Xiao's Kitchen.

Check if there are any subgoals that are accomplished by a sequence of successful actions and can be consolidated into new \"Shortcuts\" to improve efficiency for future tasks? These shortcuts are subroutines consisting of a series of atomic actions that can be executed under specific preconditions. For example, tap, type and enter text in a search bar or creating a new note in Notes.Provide your output in the following format:\n\n### New Shortcut ###\nIf you decide to create a new shortcut (not already in the existing shortcuts), provide your shortcut object in a valid JSON format which is detailed below. If not, put \"None\" here.\nA shortcut object contains the following fields: name, arguments, description, precondition, and atomic_action_sequence. The keys in the arguements need to be unique. The atomic_action_sequence is a list of dictionaries, each containing the name of an atomic action and a mapping of its atomic argument names to the shortcut's argument name. If an atomic action in the atomic_action_sequence does not take any arugments, set the `arguments_map` to an empty dict. \nIMPORTANT: The shortcut must ONLY include the Atomic Actions listed above. Create a new shortcut only if you are confident it will be useful in the future. Ensure that duplicated shortcuts with overly similar functionality are not included.\nPRO TIP: Avoid creating shortcuts with too many arguments, such as involving multiple taps at different positions. All coordinate arguments required for the shortcut should be visible on the current screen. Imagine that when you start executing the shortcut, you are essentially blind.\nFollow the example below to format the shortcut. Avoid adding comments that could cause errors with json.loads().\n \n{\n    \"name\": \"Tap_Type_and_Enter\",\n    \"arguments\": [\"x\", \"y\", \"text\"],\n    \"description\": \"Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation (useful for searching or sending messages).\",\n    \"precondition\": \"There is a text input box on the screen.\",\n    \"atomic_action_sequence\":[\n        {\"name\": \"Tap\", \"arguments_map\": {\"x\":\"x\", \"y\":\"y\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Type\", \"arguments_map\": {\"text\":\"text\"}},\n        {\"name\": \"Enter\", \"arguments_map\": {}}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n",
