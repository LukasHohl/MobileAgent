The format is: (coordinates; content). The coordinates are [x, y], where x represents the horizontal pixel position (from left to right) and y represents the vertical pixel position (from top to bottom).The extracted information is as follows:\n[82, 30]; text: 1:23\n[211, 228]; text: Sat, Feb 15\n[661, 1316]; text: Maps\n[415, 1315]; text: Chrome\n[169, 1317]; text: Keep Notes\n[166, 1643]; text: Play Store\n[415, 1643]; text: Gmail\n[662, 1644]; text: Photos\n[910, 1643]; text: YouTube\n[662, 1186]; icon: The icon is shaped like a location pin and features a combination of blue, red, yellow, and green colors.\n[415, 1186]; icon: The icon is a circular design featuring red, yellow, green, and blue segments with a blue circle in the center.\n[909, 1968]; icon: The icon is circular with a gold outer ring, featuring a multi-colored design consisting of red, green, yellow, and a blue circle at the center.\n[662, 1968]; icon: The icon is a teardrop shape in red, blue, yellow, and green, centered within a white circle that is surrounded by a light green circular border.\n[662, 1514]; icon: The icon features a circular shape with four colored segments: yellow, red, green, and blue, arranged in a pinwheel pattern against a white background.\n[168, 1186]; icon: The icon is a yellow document shape with a circular element in the center, set against a white circular background.\n[415, 1514]; icon: The icon is circular with a white background and features a stylized red \"M\" composed of three colorful segments: red, blue, and green.\n[415, 1968]; icon: The icon features a blue speech bubble shape on a white circular background.\n[168, 1515]; icon: The icon features a play button shape with four colored segments: green, red, yellow, and blue, all set against a white circular background.\n[909, 1514]; icon: The icon features a red play button inside a white oval, set against a black background.\n[168, 1969]; icon: The icon features a blue telephone handset shape set against a white circular background.\n[162, 2205]; icon: The icon consists of a stylized letter \"G\" featuring a combination of blue, red, yellow, and green colors in a rounded shape.\n[915, 2206]; icon: The icon features a stylized camera shape with a blue and yellow top, a red and green lower section, and a central circular element in blue.\n[789, 2207]; icon: The icon features a vertically oriented blue microphone shape with a colorful semicircle in red, yellow, and green beneath it.\n[661, 1965]; icon: The icon is shaped like a location pin and features a combination of blue, red, yellow, and green colors.\n[165, 1968]; icon: The icon is shaped like a telephone handset and is colored in a solid blue hue.\n[172, 1514]; icon: The icon is a triangular shape divided into four sections, colored blue, green, yellow, and red.\n[416, 1509]; icon: The icon features a stylized envelope shape, primarily in red, with blue and green accents.\n[168, 1184]; icon: The icon features a yellow background with a white circular shape in the center, complemented by a horizontal bar underneath it.\n[662, 1185]; icon: The icon features a location pin shape with a blue top, a red upper section, a yellow middle, and a green lower section, with a white circular center.\n[416, 1975]; icon: The icon features a speech bubble shape with a solid blue color and a lighter blue background.\n\nNote that a search bar is often a long, rounded rectangle. If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nNo important notes recorded.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 661, 'y': 1316}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Maps\" app icon to open Google Maps and proceed with the task of finding the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 661, 'y': 1316}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Maps\" app icon to open Google Maps and proceed with the task of finding the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 395, 'y': 148, 'text': 'late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 661, 'y': 1316}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Maps\" app icon to open Google Maps and proceed with the task of finding the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 395, 'y': 148, 'text': 'late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 284}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Open now\" filter option to adjust the search results and display only restaurants that are open beyond 9 PM. This will help narrow down the options to meet the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 661, 'y': 1316}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Maps\" app icon to open Google Maps and proceed with the task of finding the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 395, 'y': 148, 'text': 'late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 284}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Open now\" filter option to adjust the search results and display only restaurants that are open beyond 9 PM. This will help narrow down the options to meet the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 778, 'y': 282}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Top rated\" filter to sort the search results by rating and identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 661, 'y': 1316}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Maps\" app icon to open Google Maps and proceed with the task of finding the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 395, 'y': 148, 'text': 'late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 284}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Open now\" filter option to adjust the search results and display only restaurants that are open beyond 9 PM. This will help narrow down the options to meet the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 778, 'y': 282}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Top rated\" filter to sort the search results by rating and identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 503, 'y': 1887}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Menu\" button to check if it provides additional details about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action might reveal more information about its availability. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Menu\" button did not reveal any information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" Instead, it displayed menu highlights and food items, which are unrelated to the goal of verifying the restaurant's operating hours.\n\nHINT: If multiple Tap actions failed to make changes to the screen, consider using a \"Swipe\" action to view more content or use another way to achieve the current subgoal.\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\n- **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found in the provided screenshot. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 395, 'y': 148, 'text': 'late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"late-night Korean restaurant Champaign IL,\" and press Enter to initiate the search for relevant results. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 284}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Open now\" filter option to adjust the search results and display only restaurants that are open beyond 9 PM. This will help narrow down the options to meet the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 778, 'y': 282}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Top rated\" filter to sort the search results by rating and identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 503, 'y': 1887}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Menu\" button to check if it provides additional details about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action might reveal more information about its availability. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Menu\" button did not reveal any information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" Instead, it displayed menu highlights and food items, which are unrelated to the goal of verifying the restaurant's operating hours.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 124, 'y': 262}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Overview\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This is likely to help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 726, 'y': 284}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Open now\" filter option to adjust the search results and display only restaurants that are open beyond 9 PM. This will help narrow down the options to meet the user's request. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 778, 'y': 282}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Top rated\" filter to sort the search results by rating and identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 503, 'y': 1887}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Menu\" button to check if it provides additional details about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action might reveal more information about its availability. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Menu\" button did not reveal any information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" Instead, it displayed menu highlights and food items, which are unrelated to the goal of verifying the restaurant's operating hours.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 124, 'y': 262}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Overview\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This is likely to help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

Consider checking the \"About\" tab or other sections to locate the operating hours.\n\n### Important Notes ###\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones: - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found in the \"Updates\" tab. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nThe sections above provide an overview of the plan you are following, the current subgoal you are working on, the overall progress made, and any important notes you have recorded. The screenshot displays the current state of the phone.\nCarefully assess the current status to determine if the task has been fully completed. If the user's request involves exploration, ensure you have conducted sufficient investigation. If you are confident that no further actions are required, mark the task as \"Finished\" in your output. If the task is not finished, outline the next steps. If you are stuck with errors, think step by step about whether the overall plan needs to be revised to address the error.\nNOTE: If the current situation prevents proceeding with the original plan or requires clarification from the user, make reasonable assumptions and revise the plan accordingly. Act as though you are the user in such cases.\n\n### Available Shortcuts from Past Experience ###\nWe additionally provide some shortcut functionalities based on past experience. These shortcuts are predefined sequences of operations that might make the plan more efficient. Each shortcut includes a precondition specifying when it is suitable for use. If your plan implies the use of certain shortcuts, ensure that the precondition is fulfilled before using them. Note that you don't necessarily need to include the names of these shortcuts in your high-level plan; they are provided only as a reference.\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter: Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the plan and subgoals.\n\n### Plan ###\nIf an update is required for the high-level plan, provide the updated plan here. Otherwise, keep the current plan and copy it here.\n\n### Current Subgoal ###\nThe next subgoal to work on. If the previous subgoal is not yet complete, copy it here. If all subgoals are completed, write \"Finished\".\n",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones: - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found in the \"Updates\" tab. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 778, 'y': 282}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Top rated\" filter to sort the search results by rating and identify the best-rated late-night Korean restaurant in Champaign, IL. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 503, 'y': 1887}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Menu\" button to check if it provides additional details about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action might reveal more information about its availability. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Menu\" button did not reveal any information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" Instead, it displayed menu highlights and food items, which are unrelated to the goal of verifying the restaurant's operating hours.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 124, 'y': 262}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Overview\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This is likely to help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 991, 'y': 263}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Updates\" tab to check if it contains any posts or announcements that provide information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"   - Features: Free parking lot  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 503, 'y': 1887}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Menu\" button to check if it provides additional details about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action might reveal more information about its availability. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action of tapping the \"Menu\" button did not reveal any information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" Instead, it displayed menu highlights and food items, which are unrelated to the goal of verifying the restaurant's operating hours.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 124, 'y': 262}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Overview\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This is likely to help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 991, 'y': 263}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Updates\" tab to check if it contains any posts or announcements that provide information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 981, 'y': 261}} | Description: I will tap on the \"About\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"   - Features: Free parking lot  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Type(text): Type the \"text\" in an input box.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 124, 'y': 262}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Overview\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This is likely to help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 991, 'y': 263}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Updates\" tab to check if it contains any posts or announcements that provide information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 981, 'y': 261}} | Description: I will tap on the \"About\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 869, 'y': 134}} | Description: I will tap on the magnifying glass icon (search button) to initiate a search for the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" on the web. This will allow me to gather the required information. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field.

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"   - Features: Free parking lot  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below.

This action is expected to provide information about the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If no search bar is presented and you want to perform a search, you may need to tap a search button, which is commonly represented by a magnifying glass.\nAlso, the information above might not be entirely accurate. You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"   - Features: Free parking lot  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 991, 'y': 263}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Updates\" tab to check if it contains any posts or announcements that provide information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 981, 'y': 261}} | Description: I will tap on the \"About\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 869, 'y': 134}} | Description: I will tap on the magnifying glass icon (search button) to initiate a search for the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" on the web. This will allow me to gather the required information. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search. This action is expected to provide information about the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 981, 'y': 261}} | Description: I will tap on the \"About\" tab to check if it contains information about the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action may help verify if the restaurant is open beyond 9 PM. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 869, 'y': 134}} | Description: I will tap on the magnifying glass icon (search button) to initiate a search for the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" on the web.

This may help in finding the operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping on the \"Directions\" button redirected to a page for setting a start location for navigation, which does not provide additional information about the restaurant's operating hours or a link to its website.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"   - Features: Free parking lot  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 869, 'y': 134}} | Description: I will tap on the magnifying glass icon (search button) to initiate a search for the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" on the web. This will allow me to gather the required information. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search. This action is expected to provide information about the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 229, 'y': 2216}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Directions\" button to check if it provides additional information about the restaurant, such as a link to its website or contact details. This may help in finding the operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping on the \"Directions\" button redirected to a page for setting a start location for navigation, which does not provide additional information about the restaurant's operating hours or a link to its website. This action did not meet the expectation of finding the operating hours or other relevant details.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will go back to the previous screen to explore other options for finding the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action will allow me to continue the search for relevant information. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action did not result in any visible changes to the screen. The screen before and after the action remains identical, indicating that the action did not navigate to a previous page or provide new information.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

You should combine it with the screenshot to gain a better understanding.\n\n### Keyboard status ###\nThe keyboard has not been activated and you can't type.\n\n### Tips ###\nFrom previous experience interacting with the device, you have collected the following tips that might be useful for deciding what to do next:\n0. Do not add any payment information. If you are asked to sign in, ignore it or sign in as a guest if possible. Close any pop-up windows when opening an app.\n1. By default, no APPs are opened in the background.\n2. Screenshots may show partial text in text boxes from your previous input; this does not count as an error.\n3. When creating new Notes, you do not need to enter a title unless the user specifically requests it.\n\n\n### Important Notes ###\nHere are some potentially important content relevant to the user's request you already recorded:\nThe updated important notes, combining the old and new ones:  - **Masijta Grill Korean BBQ**:   - Rating: 3.9 (560 reviews)   - Price: $20\u201330   - Address: 202 N Race St   - Status: Closed, opens at 11 AM   - Description: Korean hot pot, cook-your-own BBQ, and other traditional fare offered in a relaxed setting.  - **Star Karaoke**:   - Rating: 4.1 (229 reviews)   - Price: $$   - Address: 1503 Lyndhurst Alley  - **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ**:   - Rating: 4.1 (15 reviews)   - Price: $10\u201320   - Address: 220 N Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801   - Status: Hours unknown   - Description: \"We ordered the bulgogi and japchae as well as the kimchi fried rice!!\"   - Features: Free parking lot  No new information about the operating hours of **Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ** was found. Further exploration is required.\n\n---\nCarefully examine all the information provided above and decide on the next action to perform. If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search. This action is expected to provide information about the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 229, 'y': 2216}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Directions\" button to check if it provides additional information about the restaurant, such as a link to its website or contact details. This may help in finding the operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping on the \"Directions\" button redirected to a page for setting a start location for navigation, which does not provide additional information about the restaurant's operating hours or a link to its website. This action did not meet the expectation of finding the operating hours or other relevant details.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will go back to the previous screen to explore other options for finding the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action will allow me to continue the search for relevant information. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action did not result in any visible changes to the screen. The screen before and after the action remains identical, indicating that the action did not navigate to a previous page or provide new information.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search. This action is expected to provide the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action to type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours\" and initiate a search did not produce the expected behavior. Instead of displaying search results or relevant information about the restaurant's operating hours, the screen remains on the map interface with no visible changes or new content related to the query.\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Swipe', 'arguments': {'x1': 540, 'y1': 1200, 'x2': 540, 'y2': 240}} | Description: I will swipe up to scroll further down the page and check if the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ\" are listed in a section below. This action may reveal additional details about the restaurant's hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 229, 'y': 2216}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Directions\" button to check if it provides additional information about the restaurant, such as a link to its website or contact details. This may help in finding the operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping on the \"Directions\" button redirected to a page for setting a start location for navigation, which does not provide additional information about the restaurant's operating hours or a link to its website. This action did not meet the expectation of finding the operating hours or other relevant details.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will go back to the previous screen to explore other options for finding the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action will allow me to continue the search for relevant information. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action did not result in any visible changes to the screen. The screen before and after the action remains identical, indicating that the action did not navigate to a previous page or provide new information.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search. This action is expected to provide the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action to type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours\" and initiate a search did not produce the expected behavior. Instead of displaying search results or relevant information about the restaurant's operating hours, the screen remains on the map interface with no visible changes or new content related to the query.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will return to the home screen to access the browser app. This will allow me to perform a web search for \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours\" to find the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap', 'arguments': {'x': 229, 'y': 2216}} | Description: I will tap on the \"Directions\" button to check if it provides additional information about the restaurant, such as a link to its website or contact details. This may help in finding the operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: Tapping on the \"Directions\" button redirected to a page for setting a start location for navigation, which does not provide additional information about the restaurant's operating hours or a link to its website. This action did not meet the expectation of finding the operating hours or other relevant details.\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will go back to the previous screen to explore other options for finding the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action will allow me to continue the search for relevant information. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action did not result in any visible changes to the screen. The screen before and after the action remains identical, indicating that the action did not navigate to a previous page or provide new information.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search. This action is expected to provide the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The action to type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours\" and initiate a search did not produce the expected behavior. Instead of displaying search results or relevant information about the restaurant's operating hours, the screen remains on the map interface with no visible changes or new content related to the query.\nAction: {'name': 'Home', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will return to the home screen to access the browser app. This will allow me to perform a web search for \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours\" to find the restaurant's operating hours. | Outcome: Successful\nAction: {'name': 'Open_App', 'arguments': {'app_name': 'Chrome'}} | Description: I will open the Chrome browser app to perform a web search for \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours.\" This action is expected to provide the restaurant's operating hours or lead to its website or social media pages. | Outcome: Successful\n\n---\nProvide your output in the following format, which contains three parts:\n### Thought ###\nProvide a detailed explanation of your rationale for the chosen action. IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Back', 'arguments': None} | Description: I will go back to the previous screen to explore other options for finding the operating hours of \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ.\" This action will allow me to continue the search for relevant information. | Outcome: Failed | Feedback: The \"Back\" action did not result in any visible changes to the screen. The screen before and after the action remains identical, indicating that the action did not navigate to a previous page or provide new information.\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",

If you notice an unsolved error in the previous action, think as a human user and attempt to rectify them. You must choose your action from one of the atomic actions or the shortcuts. The shortcuts are predefined sequences of actions that can be used to speed up the process. Each shortcut has a precondition specifying when it is suitable to use. If you plan to use a shortcut, ensure the current phone state satisfies its precondition first.\n\n#### Atomic Actions ####\nThe atomic action functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description` as follows:\n- Open_App(app_name): If the current screen is Home or App screen, you can use this action to open the app named \"app_name\" on the visible on the current screen.\n- Tap(x, y): Tap the position (x, y) in current screen.\n- Swipe(x1, y1, x2, y2): Swipe from position (x1, y1) to position (x2, y2). To swipe up or down to review more content, you can adjust the y-coordinate offset based on the desired scroll distance. For example, setting x1 = x2 = 540, y1 = 1200, and y2 = 240 will swipe upwards to review additional content below. To swipe left or right in the App switcher screen to choose between open apps, set the x-coordinate offset to at least 540.\n- Enter(): Press the Enter key after typing (useful for searching).\n- Switch_App(): Show the App switcher for switching between opened apps.\n- Back(): Return to the previous state.\n- Home(): Return to home page.\n- Wait(): Wait for 10 seconds to give more time for a page loading.\nNOTE: Unable to type. The keyboard has not been activated. To type, please activate the keyboard by tapping on an input box or using a shortcut, which includes tapping on an input box first.\u201d\n\n#### Shortcuts ####\nThe shortcut functions are listed in the format of `name(arguments): description | Precondition: precondition` as follows:\n- Tap_Type_and_Enter(x, y, text): Tap an input box at position (x, y), Type the \"text\", and then perform the Enter operation. Very useful for searching and sending messages! | Precondition: There is a text input box on the screen with no previously entered content.\n\n### Latest Action History ###\nRecent actions you took previously and whether they were successful:\nAction: {'name': 'Tap_Type_and_Enter', 'arguments': {'x': 283, 'y': 148, 'text': 'Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours'}} | Description: I will tap on the search bar, type \"Cho Dang Tofu & BBQ Urbana IL operating hours,\" and press Enter to initiate a web search.

Prospect, IL, rather than Urbana, IL. The operating hours listed (Monday\u2013Saturday, 11:00 AM\u20138:00 PM) are not relevant to the Urbana location.

IMPORTANT: If you decide to use a shortcut, first verify that its precondition is met in the current phone state. For example, if the shortcut requires the phone to be at the Home screen, check whether the current screenshot shows the Home screen. If not, perform the appropriate atomic actions instead.\n\n### Action ###\nChoose only one action or shortcut from the options provided. IMPORTANT: Do NOT return invalid actions like null or stop. Do NOT repeat previously failed actions.\nUse shortcuts whenever possible to expedite the process, but make sure that the precondition is met.\nYou must provide your decision using a valid JSON format specifying the name and arguments of the action. For example, if you choose to tap at position (100, 200), you should write {\"name\":\"Tap\", \"arguments\":{\"x\":100, \"y\":100}}. If an action does not require arguments, such as Home, fill in null to the \"arguments\" field. Ensure that the argument keys match the action function's signature exactly.\n\n### Description ###\nA brief description of the chosen action and the expected outcome.",
